# 4-bit-computer-design-and-simulation
A simple 4 bit computer had been designed. Design was done by Proteus Design Suite with advance simulation tool. 
Design need to folow below principles-- 

1) The fewer the T-states of instruction cycle, the better the design.
2) MSI (Medium Scale Integrated) & LSI (Large Scale Integrated) need to be fewer.
3) The bus will be of 8-bit address bus and 4-bit data bus.
4) There will be two independent units inside the processor-Fetch Unit & Execution Unit. So, two stage pipe lines will be preferable. 
5) It will be able to execute 16 commands.
